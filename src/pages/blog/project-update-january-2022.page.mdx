leadIn: Questionnaires, ethnic approvals and field work
---

Currently we are preparing the questionnaires and the database entries. There is also a lot of
administrative work to do, particularly our endeavours to obtain ethic approvals from all the
countries where fieldwork is planned. End of January two members of the team will for the first time
present preliminary results of our research at a conference in Madrid.
