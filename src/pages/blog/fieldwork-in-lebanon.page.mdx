  Ana Iriarte Diez and Claudia Laaber went to Lebanon for our project. Lebanon
  has been in the focus of the media in the last years with terrible news.

  But Ana and Claudia did not let the difficult conditions stop them and visited
  different families and Bedouin tribes in Lebanon. Some of them are respected
  groups, others are so marginalized in Lebanese society that they are even
  denied citizenship. 

  Here we would like to share a few impressions of their trip with you.
