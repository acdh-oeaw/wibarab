abstract: Fieldwork in Lebanon
leadIn: >
  Media around the world have reported on the catastrophic conditions in Lebanon
  in recent years. Even though we don't hear about it as much today, the
  situation is still tense. But Claudia Laaber and Ana Iriarte Diez did not let
  that stop them from doing their research there. 

  Despite adverse circumstances, they met people who welcomed them warmly and shared their stories with them. 

  The situation of the different Bedouin groups in Lebanon is very heterogeneous: some groups are part of society, while others - for example those living in the Beka Plain - are even denied Lebanese citizenship. They have been living as stateless people in their own country for generations.
