More than 350 million people speak Arabic in linguistic settings that are for the most part
characterised by a high degree of diglossia. Some of the countless spoken Arabic varieties in use
from Iran to Mauretania will be investigated in the framework of an ERC Advanced Grant by the
WIBARAB project (What Is Bedouin-type ARABic?).

As its name indicates, a particular concern of the WIBARAB project is the language of the Bedouins
which has spread with the Arab expansion in the Middle East and North Africa since the 7th century.
In a cooperation between the Institute of Oriental Studies (University of Vienna) and the Austrian
Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (Austrian Academy of Sciences), WIBARAB aims to
better understand the nature of the linguistic dichotomy between sedentary and nomadic varieties, a
fundamental concept to Arabic language history, by applying innovative and interdisciplinary
research methods. To pursue this goal, the project will collect new data through extensive fieldwork
in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. Along with linguistic data,
WIBARAB will also investigate social parameters, focusing in particular on the question of whether
the prevalence of tribal structures and patriarchal social patterns helps to explain the linguistic
conservatism of Bedouin dialects.

Both newly collected and already published data will be systematically stored in a database that
will allow for efficient cross-dialectal comparisons, particularly with regard to phonological,
morphological, syntactical, phraseological and lexical features. This will be possible thanks to the
help of the ACDH-CH team, which will further develop and refine its text-technological stack and
take care of data modelling and corpus design, as well as of the implementation, publication and
long-term preservation of the project's database.
