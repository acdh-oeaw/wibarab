The WIBARAB project is conducted within the ERC Advanced Grant 101020127. It runs from October 2021
to September 2026. WIBARAB adopts a combination of methods grounded in dialectology, general
linguistics, sociolinguistics, and historical interpretation.

The project comprises six Work Packages (WP):

WP-1 New linguistic data from the field generates fresh data by providing comprehensive grammatical
descriptions of three hitherto under-investigated or even unknown Bedouin-type dialects: the Bani
Sakhar in Jordan, the Zaer and Chaouia in Morocco, and the Rashayda who are geographically dispersed
in Saudi-Arabia, Kuwait, and Sudan, among other places.

WP-2 Sociolinguistics investigates how 'Bedouin speech' is perceived today and is based on six case
studies of speakers' attitudes towards Bedouin Arabic in different regions (Najd, Jordan, Lebanon,
Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco).

WP-3 Historical backgrounds is dedicated to the history of Bedouin migrations and will show how
history can provide proxy data for diachronic linguistic data and vice versa.

WP-4 Linguistic typology addresses the topic of linguistic typology and aims at a comparative survey
of grammatical and lexical features of Bedouin-type Arabic.

WP-5 Language and dialect contact deals with language and dialect contacts in past and present by
focusing on contact-induced linguistic changes that are likely the outcome of Bedouin migration.

WP-6 Historical linguistics and language change will draw on the findings of all other work packages
to present an answer to the overarching question of the degree to which difference in lifestyle,
i.e., nomadic versus sedentary, is mirrored in the history and present of the Arabic language, and
which social and/or historical factors have led to either the retention or the abandonment of
typical linguistic features related to one group or the other.
